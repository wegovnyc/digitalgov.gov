    org_primary_bio: "Digital.Gov is, a product of the General Service Administration’s Technology Transformation Service (TTS). The mission of the TTS is to “Design and deliver a digital government with and for the American public.” New York City needs its own version of the TTS to modernize its digital operations, and it needs its own version of digital.gov to create community and give support to the civil servants doing that work. We built WeGov.NYC because NYC’s government didn’t.”"
