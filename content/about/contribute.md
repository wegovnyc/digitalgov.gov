While our primary mission is helping New Yorkers implement new technologies or innovations to improve the city, WeGov.NYC has several channels to reach both stakeholders. We send out a newsletter to a broad range of people, host informational blog posts, resources, and videos on our site, as well as offer various learning opportunities.

We accept content from people working on civic and public interest technology projects including people working as an inidivudal, with for-profits, nonprofits, and government agencies. [Learn more about what our readers need »](#what-our-readers-need)

- **News, Updates, and Blog Posts** — Examples of success are some of the most powerful tools toward convincing people to follow modern practices. We are looking for posts that show what you are working on, what challenges you’re facing, or how you’re working to make digital better for the public.
- **Case Studies** — We are looking for examples of how people, projects and agencies are using digital technologies to improve the city..
- **Informational Events** — WeGov.NYC produces a calendar of events for people working to improve the city.
- **Resources, Tools, and Services** — To help people confidently take steps toward working smarter, we try to collect a list of available implementation playbooks, guidance documents, checklists, toolkits, style guides, and other similar content organized by specific topic areas.

## Submission Considerations

Just a few quick notes to consider before submitting your contribution request:

- **Your Organization** — Please identify what organization you work with. We accept contributions form all types of organizations but we will not post promotional content for vendors of proprietary technologies.
- **Format** — We can post content in various formats, including presentations, video, and written prose. We also link to content posted by other individuals and organizations. As is required for any online content, please make sure that your submission and any related files are accessible and mobile-friendly.
- **Length** — We generally like to keep people’s attention so we just ask that you consider your reader or audience.
- **Style and Editing** — WeGov.NYC tries to follow the Associated Press (AP) Style Guide and general Plain Language guidance. When we make edits, it’s usually to ensure that your content reaches and engages our audience. View our full [Digital.gov Style Guide]({{< ref "style-guide.md" >}}).
- **Visuals/Media** — Photos, screenshots, charts, and other visuals help engage the reader and keep them interested in your content. If you have visuals that we can include, please try to identify the highest resolution of the file possible (i.e., usually anything 150 dpi or greater works best) and we can work with you to adjust the image to an appropriate format and file size. Alternative text also must be provided for accessibility tools like screen readers.
- **Timing** — We generally try to post content within two weeks of your submission. Events are most successful when we post them four weeks out from the event date. So we ask that you take this into account before submitting an event. Videos from events are usually posted within a week after an event once closed captioning and other supporting information is available.
