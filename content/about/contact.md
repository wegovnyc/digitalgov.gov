**WeGov.NYC** is a fork of Digital.Gov, a website built by people at the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) at the General Services Administration (GSA). Their goal is to improve how the federal government uses digital technologies. Our goal is to improve how New York City government uses digital. We love their site, are inspired by their work and thank them for posting it to Github so we could appropriate it for our use case!
