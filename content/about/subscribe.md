**The WeGov.NYC Newsletter** is a round-up of innovative work, news and ideas from people and teams improving New York City. It also includes a list of the upcoming community events and training aimed at elevating your digital expertise. Our newsletter is sent out every few weeks.

Our strategy is to provide you with just the right amount of information to help you and your team make something 5 percent better. We’re not interested in flooding your inbox with emails you don’t need.

That said — while we aim to send one email every few weeks, we may occasionally send stand alone emails with important news items or product launches (though we'll keep those emails to a minimum).
