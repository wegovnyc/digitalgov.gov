Thirteen years in digital is an eon, and on the eve of its 13th birthday, we at [USAGov](https://www.usa.gov) found ourselves reckoning with a mid-life crisis.

In the thirteen years since Firstgov.gov was launched (and ten years for FirstGov en Español), the sheer volume and sophistication of government websites has exploded. We’ve seen Web customers evolve from timid and curious users to adroit searchers who can download music, read a newspaper, and respond to a text message simultaneously—using only their thumbs.

Things have changed, and we realized it was time to take a good, hard look at our value as a portal. Are portals obsolete? Is the USA.gov brand relevant? With the advent of search and the maturity of other government websites, does the government Web space need a front door anymore?

Tough questions. Hard questions. But absolutely crucial.





So, without further ado, here are the new [beta.USA.gov](http://beta.usa.gov/) and [beta.Gobierno.USA.gov](http://beta.gobierno.usa.gov/). Built in Drupal and built with a central content API to ingest and syndicate government information, this site is so much more than a site. It’s an invitation to agencies to use our brand, leverage our partnerships and release their valuable information out into the wild.

We need your help to make this work. So please, explore our beta sites, learn more about our design and journey mapping work, offer suggestions, and most importantly, [contact us](http://beta.usa.gov/media) if you’re interested in learning more about how you can use the platform. You can also join the conversation on [Github](https://github.com/usagov/usa.gov).

We’re excited about the new direction of the USA.gov bilingual platform and confident that no matter what the digital future brings, we can work together to keep government information and services relevant, engaging, and delightful for our customers.
