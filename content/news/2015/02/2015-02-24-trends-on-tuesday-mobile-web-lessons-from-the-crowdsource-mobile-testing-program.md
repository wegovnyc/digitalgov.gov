Practice makes perfect. But in the mobile world, it’s testing that makes products better.


Since the program’s inception in March 2013, eight federal mobile websites (including responsive design) have been tested by 65 federal employees from 41 agencies. The benefits are twofold: agencies receive actionable feedback about their mobile websites, and testers gain valuable knowledge about mobile websites that they can share with their own agencies.

During each test cycle, testers log issues specific to the application or site being tested. Four themes have emerged from the logs, with lessons that are relevant to anyone developing mobile websites.

## Shrinking the Screen Is Not Enough


  * Smaller mobile screens often mean smaller fonts and buttons that become hard to read and press.

## Inspector Gadget Sometimes Has Malfunctions ****

Some “gadgets” that enhance websites are not fully functional on mobile devices.

  * Flash video has no functionality on iOS.

## Mobile Comes in Many Sizes and Views

There are over 300 unique mobile screen resolutions that can display in both portrait and landscape.

  * The view or page layout and design that you see on the smaller smartphone screen may be totally different when viewed on a tablet.
  * Different screen resolutions need to be tested on different devices.

## WiFi Can Disrupt Functionality

Mobile devices may behave differently as they switch between WiFi and cellular data networks.

  * Responsive applications download all images and content to a device, but they only use certain parts that are critical for proper display. A busy page may be slow to load due to graphics that are not shown on the mobile page.
  * Many devices are set to automatically connect to WiFi. When a user connects to WiFi that requires a log on, the application may not display properly until the user manually logs in.
